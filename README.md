# Penguin - Decentralized Messaging Platform

## 1. Executive Summary

Penguin is a decentralized, privacy-focused messaging application built on the Sui blockchain. It leverages Walrus for decentralized storage, Seal for access control, and SuiNS for user-friendly addressing to create a secure, scalable messaging platform that puts users in control of their data.

## 2. Product Overview

### 2.1 Vision
To create a decentralized messaging platform that combines the security of blockchain technology with the user experience of modern chat applications, enabling private, censorship-resistant communication.

### 2.2 Mission
Empower users with complete control over their messaging data through decentralized storage and encryption, while maintaining the simplicity and reliability of traditional messaging apps.

### 2.3 Key Value Propositions
- **Decentralized Storage**: Messages stored on Walrus network, not centralized servers
- **Privacy-First**: End-to-end encryption with user-controlled keys
- **Censorship Resistant**: No single point of failure or control
- **User-Friendly**: Familiar chat interface with Web3 integration
- **Asset Integration**: Send and receive SUI tokens and NFTs as gifts

## 3. Technical Architecture

- **Access Control**: Seal (encryption and access policies)
- **Authentication**: zkLogin (privacy-preserving authentication)
- **Naming**: SuiNS (human-readable addresses)
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + Socket.IO

### 3.2 System Components

#### Frontend (React Application)
- **Chat Interface**: Real-time messaging with WebSocket connections
- **Wallet Integration**: Sui wallet connection and transaction signing
- **User Management**: Profile creation and SuiNS registration
- **Asset Management**: Token and NFT display and transfer

#### Backend (Lite Server)
- **Message Queue**: Temporary storage for offline message delivery
- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time communication hub

### 3.3 Data Flow
1. User sends message → Local storage (immediate UI update)
2. Message queued in backend → WebSocket delivery to recipient
3. Background backup → Walrus storage (encrypted)
4. Message recovery → Walrus retrieval and decryption
